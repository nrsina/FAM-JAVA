# FAM-JAVA
Java code sample for the Fabric-Attached Memory emulator of The Machine
https://github.com/FabricAttachedMemory/Emulation

Compile and Run:

javac MemoryMappedIO.java

java MemoryMappedIO

Also, made a small change to emulation_configure.bash to make it able to run on Ubuntu 16+ and Debian 9+ (Thanks to Alireza Sanaee)
